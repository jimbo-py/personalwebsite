                <h3>MEDALS: Machine-Learning-Driven Early Detection of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</h3>
                <p>Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of nerve cells within the brain and spinal cord. ALS affects 450,000 people worldwide with a 20 percent survival rate by year 5. Early detection is critical to improve life expectancy and quality of life. Yet current diagnostic methods, like Electromyography (EMG) and Nerve Conduction Studies, are invasive, costly, and are inaccessible.There is a lack of research for cost-effective, accurate, and simple diagnostic methods. 
                    Biomarkers are measurable biological indicators that help detect the presence or progression of diseases. The detection of biomarkers offers a simple yet powerful detection method. For ALS, biomarkers P75NTR and neopterin,typically found in urine, are viable. A lateral flow immunoassay (LFA), enhanced by fluorescent labeling with quantum dots amplified nano-gold/nano-silver shell nanoparticles, offers a novel, sensitive, and specific method for biomarker detection. Biomarker detection is important, but correct interpretation is paramount for diagnosis. Our machine learning model paired with an interactive user interface, incorporates patient-specific factors (e.g., age, sex, ALSFRS-R score) and analyzes the LFA. It provides diagnoses with a 96% accuracy in real life testing. The model is able to intake images of nerve fibers after biopsy, and use nerve fiber/cell analysis to enhance diagnosis. Diagnosing ALS through the use of Machine Learning has rarely been tested, offering a new path in neurodegenerative disease diagnosis. This system offers a cost-effective, accessible, and advanced diagnostic hardware/software tool to address current limitations in ALS early detection.
